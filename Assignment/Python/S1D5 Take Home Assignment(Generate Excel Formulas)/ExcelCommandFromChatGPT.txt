Overall Trends:

Formula: To find the overall trends across different years, you can use a Pivot Table to summarize the data by year. This will give you a visual representation of trends.
Steps:
Insert a Pivot Table.
Drag the "Year" field to Rows and "Number of Cases" (or equivalent) to Values.
Analyze the trend line to observe overall trends.
Rates Comparison:

Formula: Use the =MAX() and =MIN() functions to find areas with the highest and lowest rates of property crime.
Steps:
Create a Pivot Table with "Area" in Rows and "Crime Rate" in Values.
Use the =MAX(range) and =MIN(range) formulas to identify the highest and lowest rates.
Cases and Values Comparison:

Formula: To compare the number of cases and the value of property stolen versus recovered, use =SUMIFS() to sum up the values.
Steps:
Create columns for "Cases Stolen" and "Cases Recovered."
Use =SUMIFS(stolen_value_range, criteria_range, criteria) for stolen and recovered values.
Recovery Ratio:

Formula: Calculate the ratio using = (Recovered / Stolen).
Steps:
Create columns for "Total Property Stolen" and "Total Property Recovered."
Use =B2/A2 where B2 is the recovered value and A2 is the stolen value.
Comparative Analysis
Value Comparison:

Formula: To compare values across different groups, use =AVERAGEIFS() to calculate the average stolen value.
Steps:
Create a Pivot Table with "Group" or "Sub-Group" in Rows and "Value of Property Stolen" in Values.
Use =AVERAGEIFS(value_range, criteria_range, criteria) to compare.
Seasonal Patterns:

Formula: To find seasonal patterns, use =MONTH() and =YEAR() to analyze monthly and yearly trends.
Steps:
Create a Pivot Table with "Month" and "Year" in Rows and "Number of Cases" in Values.
Analyze for patterns or use a line graph.
Regional Analysis
Area Variation:

Formula: Use a Pivot Table to observe variations.
Steps:
Create a Pivot Table with "Area" in Rows and "Crime Rate" in Values.
Use conditional formatting to highlight significant increases or decreases.
Stolen vs. Recovered Values:

Formula: Compare stolen and recovered values using a simple subtraction or ratio formula.
Steps:
Create columns for "Value Stolen" and "Value Recovered."
Use =C2-D2 where C2 is the stolen value and D2 is the recovered value to see differences.
