Single threaded only one task at the time.
JavaScript is a single threaded, Synchronous and dynamically typed language

Compile time:
javascript is converted into machine code 
run time:
converted into machine code, it will execute

at the vs code at the bottom right we will have the (Go Live) click on it


var num = 66;
var num = 77;
// var is a keyword to declare the variable and var is a global scope var can be redeclared and it can be re-assigned

let num2 = 77;
num2 = 88;
// let num2 = 88; // not creating again
//let is a keyword to declare the variable and let is a block scope
// let can be reassigned but not redeclared
redeclaring example:
let name = "one";
let name = "two";

const num3 = 88;
// const is a keyword to declare the variable const is also block scoped const cant be reassigned or cant be redeclared

const num3 = 88;
//redeclaration
const num3 = 66;
num3 = 99;

Primitive datatypes: 
Number 
string
Boolean
Big int 
Null 
undefined
Symbol

for big integer at the last we have n
let bignumber = 454525888888888888888n;

let nullData = null;
let name;
//typeof gives the datatype
console.log(typeof(nullData))

let symboldata = Symbol("Hello")
