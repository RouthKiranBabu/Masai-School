In the Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC), the phase that involves executing test cases and logging defects is the **Execution Phase**. 

Here's a quick breakdown of the phases leading up to and including the Execution Phase:

1. **Requirement Analysis**: Understand and analyze the requirements to determine what needs to be tested.
2. **Test Planning**: Develop a test plan, including scope, approach, resources, schedule, and test deliverables.
3. **Test Design**: Design and create test cases, test scripts, and other test documentation based on the requirements and test plan.
4. **Test Environment Setup**: Prepare the environment in which testing will occur, including hardware, software, and network configurations.
5. **Execution Phase**:
   - **Execute Test Cases**: Run the test cases according to the test plan and record the results.
   - **Log Defects**: If discrepancies or issues are found, log them into a defect tracking system for further analysis and resolution.

6. **Test Closure**: Evaluate cycle completion criteria based on test coverage, quality, cost, time, critical business objectives, etc. Prepare test closure reports and conduct retrospectives if necessary.

In the Execution Phase, testers not only execute the tests but also ensure that any defects or issues are properly documented and communicated to the development team for resolution.
